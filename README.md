# Burger-King-Project
Burger King Project contains dataset where several excel functions are used to answer few questions 


I recently completed an exciting project where I analyzed the nutritional information of various food items from Burger King using Excel. The dataset I worked on contained details such as the item name, category, calories, fat calories, saturated fat, cholesterol, protein, and Weight Watchers points.

For this project, I leveraged a variety of Excel functions to draw insights from the data. To give an overview, I used the COUNTIF function to determine the total carbohydrates in all chicken items, which helped me understand the overall nutritional contribution of chicken products. To analyze the breakfast items, I summed up the total protein using the SUMIF function, gaining insights into the protein content of breakfast foods. Similarly, I calculated the average calorie count for all burger items using AVERAGEIF, allowing me to compare the calorie values across different burgers.

To push the boundaries of analysis further, I employed the MAX function to identify the item with the highest calorie count and the MIN function to find the item with the least protein. I also summed up the fat calories using SUMIF to analyze the total fat content across all items. In one interesting case, I used the POWER function to square the calorie count of the WhopperÂ® Sandwich, exploring how certain items stood out nutritionally.

Throughout this project, Excel's numerical functions played a crucial role in making sense of the data. By utilizing functions like COUNTIF, SUMIF, AVERAGEIF, POWER, MAX, and MIN, I was able to extract meaningful insights, answer key questions, and build a clearer picture of the nutritional value of various Burger King items. The experience strengthened my data analysis skills and deepened my understanding of how to use Excel for real-world problem-solving.
